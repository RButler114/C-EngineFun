# Options Menu Navigation Test

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Black Screen Issue (FIXED ✅)
The options menu had a navigation issue where users would get a black screen and couldn't return to the main menu.

**Root Cause**: State transition logic issue
- **MenuState** used `ChangeState(GameStateType::OPTIONS)` to go to options
- **OptionsState** used `PopState()` to go back
- `ChangeState()` **replaces** the current state entirely (clears the stack)
- `PopState()` expects there to be a state underneath to return to
- Since `ChangeState()` cleared the stack, there was nothing to pop back to → black screen

**Solution**: Changed MenuState to use `PushState(GameStateType::OPTIONS)` instead of `ChangeState()`

### 2. Option Selection Issue (FIXED ✅)
Some options (Sound Volume, Back to Menu) were not selectable while others (Music Volume, Keybindings) worked.

**Root Cause**: Input handling inconsistency across ALL input types
- **MenuState** used `IsKeyPressed()` with manual debouncing for ENTER key (reliable)
- **OptionsState** used `IsKeyJustPressed()` for ALL keys (unreliable)
- The MenuState code even had a comment: "using IsKeyPressed with debouncing since IsKeyJustPressed has issues"
- This caused inconsistent input detection for:
  - **Navigation** (UP/DOWN/W/S keys) - couldn't navigate to all options
  - **Selection** (ENTER/SPACE keys) - some options appeared unresponsive
  - **Value adjustment** (LEFT/RIGHT/A/D keys) - inconsistent volume control
  - **Back navigation** (B/ESCAPE keys) - unreliable return to menu

**Solution**:
- Changed OptionsState to use the same reliable input handling approach as MenuState for **ALL input types**
- Implemented manual debouncing for ALL keys: UP, DOWN, W, S, LEFT, RIGHT, A, D, ENTER, SPACE, B, ESCAPE
- Used `IsKeyPressed()` instead of `IsKeyJustPressed()` for all input detection
- Removed duplicate code in DrawOptions method
- Added `GetOptionCount()` helper method for consistent bounds checking

## Test Instructions
1. Build and run the game: `cd build && make -j4 && ./bin/GameEngine`
2. Navigate to "OPTIONS" in the main menu (use arrow keys)
3. Press ENTER to enter options menu
4. **Test all options are selectable:**
   - Navigate to "Music Volume" → Press ENTER (should play sound)
   - Navigate to "Sound Volume" → Press ENTER (should play sound)
   - Navigate to "Keybindings" → Press ENTER (should enter keybinding mode)
   - Navigate to "Back to Menu" → Press ENTER (should return to main menu)
5. **Test volume adjustment:**
   - Navigate to Music/Sound Volume → Use LEFT/RIGHT arrows to adjust
6. **Test navigation:**
   - Use UP/DOWN arrows to move between all options
   - Verify selection indicator (>) appears for all options

## State Transition Patterns
- **Major transitions** (different game modes): Use `ChangeState()`
  - Menu → Customization → Playing → Game Over
- **Overlay/temporary states** (should return to previous): Use `PushState()`/`PopState()`
  - Menu → Options (overlay)
  - Playing → Combat (temporary)
  - Playing → Pause Menu (overlay)

## Files Modified
- `src/Game/MenuState.cpp`:
  - Changed line 228 from `ChangeState()` to `PushState()`
  - Fixed navigation direction: UP key now moves selection up, DOWN key moves selection down
- `src/Game/OptionsState.cpp`:
  - Fixed input handling to use `IsKeyPressed()` with manual debouncing for ALL keys
  - Navigation keys (UP/DOWN/W/S) now use reliable input detection
  - Selection keys (ENTER/SPACE) now use reliable input detection
  - Value adjustment keys (LEFT/RIGHT/A/D) now use reliable input detection
  - Back navigation keys (B/ESCAPE) now use reliable input detection
  - Fixed navigation direction: UP key now moves selection up, DOWN key moves selection down
  - Removed duplicate code in DrawOptions method
  - Added `GetOptionCount()` helper method for consistent bounds checking
  - Cleaned up debug output
- `include/Game/OptionsState.h`: Added GetOptionCount() method declaration

## Technical Details

### Input Handling Fix
The core issue was that `IsKeyJustPressed()` has reliability problems that cause inconsistent input detection. The fix involved applying manual debouncing to ALL input types:

**Navigation Fix:**
```cpp
// BEFORE (unreliable):
if (input->IsKeyJustPressed(SDL_SCANCODE_UP)) {
    NavigateUp();
}

// AFTER (reliable):
static bool upWasPressed = false;
bool upPressed = input->IsKeyPressed(SDL_SCANCODE_UP);
if (upPressed && !upWasPressed) {
    NavigateUp();
}
upWasPressed = upPressed;
```

**Selection Fix:**
```cpp
// BEFORE (unreliable):
if (input->IsKeyJustPressed(SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN)) {
    SelectOption();
}

// AFTER (reliable):
static bool enterWasPressed = false;
bool enterPressed = input->IsKeyPressed(SDL_SCANCODE_RETURN);
if (enterPressed && !enterWasPressed) {
    SelectOption();
}
enterWasPressed = enterPressed;
```

This manual debouncing approach ensures consistent input detection for navigation, selection, value adjustment, and back navigation.

### Navigation Direction Fix
The navigation direction was reversed - UP key was moving selection down and DOWN key was moving selection up. Fixed by swapping the logic in both NavigateUp() and NavigateDown() functions:

**Before (reversed):**
- UP key → NavigateUp() → `m_selectedOption--` (moved to previous option visually)
- DOWN key → NavigateDown() → `m_selectedOption++` (moved to next option visually)

**After (correct):**
- UP key → NavigateUp() → `m_selectedOption--` (moves to lower index, visually up)
- DOWN key → NavigateDown() → `m_selectedOption++` (moves to higher index, visually down)

**Note:** The fix required different logic for MenuState vs OptionsState due to how the function names were originally implemented, but both now work correctly with UP moving selection up and DOWN moving selection down.
